// you are not intended to read or understand this file
// it provides 2 functions:
// 1. later(targetQuery, callback) finds a valediction that is appropriate for a targetQuery.
//    targetQuery: to whom you'd like to offer an appropriate valediction (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valediction)
//                  (if it is a substring of a known target, the corresponding valediction will be provided,
//                   otherwise a random one will be selected)
//    callback: function that you want later to call with the valediction result when it's ready.
//              this function will be called with the following argument:
//        result: an object with the keys:
//            target: to whom the result is intended to go
//            valediction: what to say to the target
// 2. options(callback, query) finds all known valediction targets or those that include the substring specified in query, if it's provided.
//    callback: function that you want options to call with the known valediction targets, when they're ready.
//              this function will be called with the following argument:
//        keys: an array of known valediction targets
//    query: a constraint on which valediction targets to include. Only those of which query is a substring will be included.
